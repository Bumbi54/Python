Whenever a Python program is called, Python will check, if there exists a compiled version with the .pyc suffix. This file has to be newer than the file with the .py suffix.
If such a file exists, Python will load the byte code, which will speed up the start up time of the script.

If a Python script is imported as a module, the byte code will be stored in the corresponding .pyc file.

In this line of codes:
  x = 5       #x is assigned value 5.
  y = x       #y point to the same location as x
  y = 6       #In new location y is assigned value 6 and x still have same value 5

""//"" can be used as operator in numeric operations for floor division.
"**" operator for exponentiation

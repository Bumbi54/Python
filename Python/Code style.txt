When working with list, dictionaries or set put each element in new line and end this new line with comma.
  mylist = [
    'Snow',
    'Rain',
    'Sunny'
      ]

For opening files it is recommended to use "with" statement.
  >>>with open("file.txt", 'r') as f:
  It ensures that files are closed automatically afterwards.

With "threading lock" "with" statement can be used:
  >>>mylock = threading-Lock()
  >>>with mylock:

Python and underscore:
  1. Single leading underscore
    _var
    Convection only.
    It means variable or method is for internal use only (private).
    When wildcard importing, variables and methods with leading underscore wont be imported.
      Only if module defines "__all__".
  2. Single trailing underscore
     class_
     By Convection only.
     Use only naming variable with name that is already taken by keyword in python (class, def, syn).
  3. Double leading underscore
     Used by python interpreter.
     Used in classes so there is no collision with names in subclasses.
     Python interpreter rewrites name of such variable or methods (name mangling).
     It protect variable from been overwritten.
     Also called "dunders‚Äù.
  4. Double leading and trailing underscore
     "name mangling" is not used in this case.
     Reserved for special use.
     Usage is not recommended.
  5. Single underscore
      Convection only.
      This is used as temporary variable in function that need to return something.
      Users don't care about value in this variable.
      For example in for loop when we don't care about looing element.




Avoid wildcard import;
  from modulename import *

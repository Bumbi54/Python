import atexit
  The atexit module defines a single function to register cleanup functions. Functions thus registered are automatically executed upon normal interpreter termination.
  atexit runs these functions in the reverse order in which they were registered; if you register A, B, and C, at interpreter termination time they will be run in the order C, B, A.
    -atexit.register("FUNCTION_NAME")
    -atexit.register(Disconnect, serviceInstance)

import operator
  Efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python.
    -x + y -> operator.add(x, y)
  -itemgetter()
    Fetch an item from object.
      For example value from dictionary or indexed item from list.

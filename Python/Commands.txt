Printing lines:
	print "Line od tekst"

Command import can be used for generating byte code:
	-import name_script.py
		Creates files name_script.pxc which is byte code prom .py.

Every instance in Python has identity, which can be access with command (identity function):
	-id(NAME)
		With this command we can se inner work of Python with storing variables.

Size of:
	len("Moje ime")

Function input() takes user input from keyboard:
	var = input("String that will be printed")
		Parameter of input function will be printed out to user before he can enter his input.
		If you are entering string as value in input, entire string need to be in quotations marks.
		Input function cast the value in appropriate data type but user defines that data type with the way he enters input ("", []).
		For example if user enters ["one","two"] for input Python will cast this input into variable that has type list.

Function raw_input () also takes user input but it doesn't interpret it.
	var = raw_input("String that will be printed")
		It cast all inputs to string but user can cast result of function into data type of his own choice.
		For example using function eval() but is not recommended (security issue)

Function type() takes variable as parameter and print it type:
	type(INT_VAR)
		Prints: "int"

Condition statements:
	IF:
		if TRUE:
			CODE
		elif FALE:
			CODE
		else:
			CODE
	IF different way of writing:
		var = x if (x > y) else y;


Read from standard input:
	sys.stdin.read(1)

Generating random numbers:
	random.random()
		Numbers are decimal are between 0-1

Loop for:
	for var in something:
		CODE
	else:
	CODE

Generating and iterating over sequence of numbers:
	range(END_NUM)
	range(BEGIN, END)
	range(BEGIN, END, STEP)
	Useful in for loop.

Coping the lists:
	Import:
		from copy import deepcopy
	list1 = deepcopy(list2)
	This function copies all sublists as well but strings are not copied.

Return list of names from current context:
	>>dir()
	Return attributes of object:
		>>dir(class_name)

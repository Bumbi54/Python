Use of "*" in tuple and dictionary(unpacking generalization):
  Function can be called with value of tuple elements as arguments:
      Function foo(x, y) prints arguments. t = (1, 2) dict = {'x': 1, 'y' :2}
      -foo(*t) -> 1, 2
      -foo(**dict) -> 1, 2
  Can be used for merging dictionaries:
    -d = {**dict , **otherDict}
      Result is new dictionary "d" with combined "keys" from other two (or more) dictionaries.
        If merging dictionaries have conflict in keys the last value for that key is used (dictionary on the outmost left that has that key).

Enumerate:
  Using enumerate we can iterate over list and also get index of each element.
    -for i, a in enumerate(list) -> where "i" is an index and "a" is element of that list on that index.

Zip:
  Zip takes any number of iterable elements and puts each iteration in tuple.
  It stops when shortest iterable is exhausted.
  It returns iterator of tuples - be careful it is an object
  For example if we want to iterate over two lists.

Alternative to zip which is faster:
  from itertools import izip
  Only python2! Python3 build in "zip" behaves like "izip".

Command-line frameworks:
  optparse - not used any more
  argparse - standard for the CLI in python
  click - alternative to argparse
    Easer to use but it doesn't have all the functions of "argparse".

Command-line frameworks click:
  -@click.command()
    Initialize "click".
  -@click.argument('location')
    Add mandatory argument in variable name "location".
  -@click.option('--api-key', '-a', help='your API key for the OpenWeatherMap API',)
    Add optional argument in variable "api_key".

Selenium and automation:
  Browser are used in "headless browser" mode.
    Automated control of web page.
    Executed over command-line of network communication.
    Execution of JavaScript is available.

Sorting dictionaries in python:
  -sorted(dict)
    Returns list of sorted keys.
  -sorted(dict.items())
    Returns list of tuples sorted by first element (key).
  -sorted(dict.items(), key = lambda x : x[1])
    Returns list of tuples sorted by second element (values in dictionary).
  -sorted(xs.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
    Using "itemgetter".

When working with network resources it is best practise to use closing():
  -with closing(get(url, stream=True))
  This ensures that network resources are freed when exiting this block.

Retrieve value in dictionary:
  -get('key', default)
    Using this function on dictionary return value from 'key' in dictionary. If this key doesn't exist it returns default.
    Useful because it doesn't causes error and crash when getting value from dictionary for key that doesn't exist.

Assert:
  Debugging aid.
  If correct nothing happens.
  If failed "AssertionError" exception is raised.
  It used for errors/problems we are not expecting
  -assert_stmt ::= "assert" expression1 ["," expression2]
    "expression1" is condition that is checked
    "expression2" is optional error message
  Don't use it to validate data.
    It can be turned off when running python code.
    Careful with tuples because they assert as true if not empty.

For calling function in code periodically use "Schedule":
  Call function every x minutey:
    >>>schedule.every(10).minutes.do(myfunc)
  Call function every day at x time:
    >>>schedule.every().day.at('10:30').do(mytask)

Adding elements of two list (elements with same index are added):
  >>> map(add, list1, list2)
  Or use numpy:
    Make vector of each list and add two vector together.
      >>>vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
      >>>vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
      >>>sum_vector = vector1 + vector2
  Or with "zip":
    [sum(x) for x in zip(list1, list2)]
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18713321/element-wise-addition-of-2-lists
  
Do operation on all elements of a list:
  >>>map(lambda x : math.trunc(int(x) / 3) - 2 ,listModuleMass)

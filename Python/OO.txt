For creating class:
  class NAME:

Instantiate an object:
  a = NameOfClass()

Attributes don't need to be defined in class definition but can be defied on objects.
  a.x = 5

Definition of method is the almost same as that of functions, difference is that method needs to have parameter "self"
  def name(self):
    Name of "self" can be changed.
    "self" is just a reference to an object on which it is been called to.
  Method can be called on object reference:
    a.methodName()
  Method can be called on class in which case we pass object reference as parameter (it is "self" parameter in method definition):
    Class.firstMethod(a)

Context manager can be implemented in objects:
    >>>__enter__
    >>>__exit__
    When Object enter with statement it executes __enter__ and when it leaves it executes __exit__
